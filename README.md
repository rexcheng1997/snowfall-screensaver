# Snowfall Screensaver
A screensaver for Windows in C# with preview in JavaScript.  
**Note**: The small-screen preview and configure window haven't been implemented yet, so there will be pop-ups when you try to do so. However, the full-screen preview is implemented.

### Requirements:

**Note**: *All the requirements listed here are what I used to build and test the screensaver. If you just want to apply the screensaver to your computer, what you need is Windows 10 ONLY.*

* Windows 10
* Visual Studio 2019
* C#
* .NET Framework 4.7.2

### Installation:

1. `git clone` the repository to your computer.

2. Under folder `cs`, find the screensaver execution file `screensaver.scr`.

3. Right click `screensaver.scr` and choose the `install` option.

**Note**: You will see some pop-ups during this step. Just click the **OK** button. These pop-ups are just telling you that some of the features have not been developed yet.

4. You will be led to the configure window of Windows screensavers.
